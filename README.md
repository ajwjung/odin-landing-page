# Landing Page

This is the second project for The Odin Project, where we build a website from scratch based on a picture of the desired product. We are also provided a list of the font families, styles, and colors to use for the webpage's theme. Full project details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

## Project Details

The website has four main sections plus the footer: (1) header and hero text, (2) simple gallery of photos, (3) quote block, and (4) call to action. After creating a general layout much like that shown by The Odin Project, I changed the theme colors and added some simple text to tie the theme together. I went for an Asian-themed gallery because I am very interested in and enjoy Asian culture.
